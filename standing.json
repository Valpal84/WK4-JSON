    "lyrics": "You could never know what it's like\ryour blood like winter freezes just like ice\rand there's a cold lonely light that shines from you\ryou'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use\rAnd did you think this fool could never win\rwell look at me I'm coming back again\rI got a taste of love in a simple way\rand if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away\rDon't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did\rlooking like a true survivor feeling like a little kid\rand I'm still standing after all this time\rpicking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind\rI'm still standing (yea yea yea)\rI'm still standing (yea yea yea)\rOnce I never could hope to win\ryou starting down the road laving me again\rthe threats you made were meant to cut me down\rand if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now\rY'know I'm still standing better than I ever did\rAlle looking like a true survivor feeling like a little kid\rand I'm still standing after all this time\rElton picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind\rJohn I'm still standing (yea yea yea) I'm still standing (yea yea yea)\rDon't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did\rStill looking like a true survivor feeling like a little kid and I'm still standing after all this time\rStanding picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind\rI'm still standing (yea yea yea) I'm still standing (yea yea yea)\rI'm still standing (yea yea yea) I'm still standing (yea yea yea)\rI'm still standing (yea yea yea) I'm still standing (yea yea yea)"
